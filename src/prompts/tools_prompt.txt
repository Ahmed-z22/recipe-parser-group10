You extract COOKING TOOLS and KITCHEN EQUIPMENT from a single recipe step.

INPUT FORMAT:
You will be given an INPUT JSON block like:
{"step": "<one recipe-direction step>"}

The "step" value is a single instruction sentence or clause from a recipe.

YOUR TASK:
Identify all kitchen tools and cooking equipment explicitly mentioned in that step.

Examples of tools/equipment:
- pans, pots, skillets, woks, baking sheets, trays, roasting pans, saucepans
- bowls, colanders, strainers, sieves, cutting boards
- utensils: spoons, spatulas, tongs, whisks, ladles, peelers, graters, knives
- appliances: oven, stove, blender, mixer, food processor, microwave, slow cooker
- other equipment: rolling pin, measuring cup, measuring spoon, mortar and pestle

WHAT TO IGNORE:
- Ingredients/food: oil, salt, chicken, onions, dough, sauce, etc.
- Abstract actions: heat, cook, bake (these are methods, not tools)
- Containers that are clearly packaging only: bag, package, wrapper (unless clearly used as a cooking vessel)
- Human body parts or generic objects: hand, finger, table, counter

NORMALIZATION RULES:
For every tool you detect, return a single normalized string:
- all lowercase
- remove any leading article: “a”, “an”, “the”
- keep descriptive modifiers that belong to the tool:
  - e.g. "a large skillet" → "large skillet"
  - "the wooden spoon" → "wooden spoon"
  - "a nonstick frying pan" → "nonstick frying pan"
- do NOT include quantities or measurements:
  - "two large bowls" → "large bowl"
  - "3 small pans" → "small pan"

OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT):
Return ONLY a JSON array of strings, with no extra text, no keys, no comments.
- Example valid outputs:
  - []
  - ["large skillet"]
  - ["large skillet", "wooden spoon"]
- No prose or explanation before or after.
- If there are no tools, return [].

DEDUPLICATION:
- If the same tool appears more than once, include it only once.
- If two mentions are the same except for number, normalize to singular form:
  - "two bowls and one bowl" → "bowl" or "large bowl" if described.

DISAMBIGUATION:
- If a noun phrase clearly names a physical item used for cooking, treat it as a tool.
- If it could be either an ingredient or a tool, use context:
  - "in a mixer" → tool
  - "add the mixer" (as ingredient) → do NOT include
- Prefer concrete, manipulable objects used to cook, mix, heat, hold, or process food.

YOUR RESPONSE:
Return only the JSON array of normalized tool strings.
